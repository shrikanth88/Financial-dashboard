The dashboard gives an overall view of the revenue flow. The first row shows the Overall Income generated, Overall Expense and Overall Savings.

The Second row filters the financials based on the filters selected, i.e Particular year or month.
 The Total Expense and Savings give you the % each component(ex: EMI's, groceries etc..) is contributing and if you hover over individual bars you can see a tooltip popping out which shows the graph of overall increase/decrease during a particular period of time.

The line chart shows the Income, Expense and Savings with the savings target line (25% of Income).

The Matrix shows the detailed view of the Income, Savings and Expenses based on years and months.
